How to install it?
•if you have TWRP Recovery, you can easily install this with it. Download the zip & flash.

If you don't TWRP recovery,you can install it manually with Mixplorer. Extract my zip file, copy the the folder name Xenon54 from the bin folder & paste it to system/bin & set permission to 751(rwx r-x--x), now copy the file from data/local (Xenon54) & paste it to data/local & set the permission to 755(rwx r-x r-x). Then reboot your phone:))

How to Use it?
•Open any termial app( i suggest terminal emulator)
•type `su` & click enter
•Then type `Xenon54` & click enter.
A preview will be popped up.
•Go to data/local,there you'll see two folders stock & port. Put your stock recovery/boot in it, in port folder, put your port recovery/boot.

Bugs: Nothing, if you find any,Lemme know
