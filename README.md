# Rec-Boot Bot

# A custom recovery is a third-party recovery environment. Flashing this recovery environment onto your device replaces the default, stock recovery environment with a third-party, customized recovery environment.
# boot. img contains the kernel and ramdisk, critical files necessary to load the device before the filesystem can be mounted. You have to generate the boot. img yourself using mkbootimg, a tool provided by AOSP.
